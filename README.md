# Narwhal Optimizer (NO) - A Novel Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the **Narwhal Optimizer (NO)**, a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm proposed in the paper titled *"Narwhal Optimizer: A Novel Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithm"* by Seyyid Ahmed Medjahed and Fatima Boukhatem. The NO algorithm is inspired by the hunting behavior of narwhals, specifically their use of echolocation to locate prey. The algorithm mimics the signal emission, propagation, and position updating mechanisms observed in narwhals during their hunting process.

The NO algorithm is designed to solve global optimization problems and has been benchmarked on various functions, demonstrating its effectiveness in avoiding local minima and achieving global optimality.
